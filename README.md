## Description

Simple Stocks is an easy way to manage your stock portfolio! Unlike other apps, this app only provides you with basic information. You input only the stock symbol and the number of shares you own. The app takes care of the rest.

After setting up your portfolio, you get a quick snapshot of the value of each holding and a total portfolio value. This app was created for the trader who has a conservative, long-term outlook - it is not for day traders!

This is a full-stack application based on my previous project that I, very creatively, named [Web Components - Stock Market App](https://github.com/sg0703/Web_Components). On the front-end, Simple Stocks utilizes vanilla JavaScript, Web Components, and custom CSS styling. On the back-end, I use Node, Express, and MongoDB Atlas.

Check back for when the app is launched. Currently in development.
